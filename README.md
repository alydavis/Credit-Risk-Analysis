# Credit Risk Analysis
## Overview
Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. In this project, I use different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. 

## Resources
Dataset: Credit Card data from [LendingClub](https://www.lendingclub.com/)
<br> Libraries:
- [imbalanced-learn](https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/) 0.9.1
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) 1.1.2

## Results
